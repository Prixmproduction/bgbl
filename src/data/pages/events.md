  title: What people are saying
  reviews:
    - quote: I have never felt so expressive in a long while and I'm glad that I took the opportunity. I'm thankful for Miss Leslie-Ann Murray for opening up my mind and thoughts much more to the creative world of Short Story Writing a woman of knowledge and substance.
      author: Writing Workshop participant
      location: East Yard, Trinidad & Tobago
    - quote: I love Leslie-Ann's depth and analysis on writing practice and her use of prompts to illustrate the lesson.
      author: Writing Workshop participant
      location: Worcester Public Library
    - quote: Leslie-Ann was a fantastic instructor, warm, thoughtful, and welcoming. She created a space that was creative, curious, and encouraging. I only regret that we had just two hours! I made more  progress in my creative writing in those two hours than I have in probably two years.
